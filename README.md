# Keep Android Open

**Keep Android Open** is a [community advocacy website](https://keepandroidopen.org) fighting against Google's 2025 developer verification mandate, which will require all developers to be registered with Google.

## Purpose

Launched in direct response to the Google announcement, the site defends Android's core promise: an open platform where anyone can build, share, and install apps without centralized gatekeeping.
It aims to inform on the impacts on consumers, developers, states and coordinate resistance.

## Contributing

2. Fork this repository.
3. Make the changes.
4. Create a pull request.

## Translations Needed!

To provide a translation into a new language like Italian (language code: "it"):

1. [Edit the `_layouts/default.html`](https://github.com/keepandroidopen/keepandroidopen.github.io/edit/main/_layouts/default.html) in a fork and update the language menu at the end with the new language code.
2. Create a new top-level file `index-<langcode>.md` and add the translation of the English `index.md` file. Translate the markdown headers and page content. The most important text is at the beginning; the lists of links do not all need to be translated.
3. Commit changes to your fork and file a Pull Request with your translation.
